The vineyard is run using organic management where possible and is certified under the Sustainable Winegrowing Association of Australia. \nBondar's vision is to make wines that are bright, structured, mid-weight, yet concentrated in flavour, and with a savoury element. In the winemaking process Andre uses minimal chemical inputs, preferring to use techniques such as whole bunches, extended time on skins, and picking the fruit earlier, to achieve the balanced, bright wines for which they strive.\nBondar won James Halliday's Best New Winery Award (2017) and has now reached (the highest) 5 red-star rating. The wines have been awarded numerous 90+ scores, Andre Bondar was named one of the Top 50 Young Guns of Wine in 2018 and 2020, and their Rayner Vineyard was named one of the top 50 vineyards of Australia in 2021 (YGOW).\nBondar share a cellar door on McMurtrie Road with two other boutique producers, Lino Ramble and Sherrah Wines."

Inspired by the complexities and puzzles of winemaking, Chester created a five-story building modelled on the world’s most iconic puzzle - the Rubik’s Cube. Each of the five levels have been carefully designed to entice and excite the senses, including the d’Arenberg Cube’s South-East Asian inspired restaurant Singapore Circus, The Salvador Dali Exhibition and Sale, the Alternate Realities Museum with a 360 degree video room, virtual fermenter and sensory room, as well as wine experiences that challenge convention."

People love H&L wines because they are fresh and vibrant. Their house style is defined by fruit forward wines with lively acidity, smooth tannins, and modest use of oak — all attributes which make their wines pair so easily with food.   \nEnjoy their award-winning McLaren Vale wines and generous hospitality at the H&L Cellar Door in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Take in the views of the vines as you unwind on the front deck with a wine flight and one of ‘SA’s Best Platters’ (as awarded by Adelady) or settle in on one of the Chesterfield by the fire – you could definitely spend an afternoon here.\nDogs and children welcome!"

Their goal was, and remains, to produce affordable, quality wines that express the true character of McLaren Vale. \nThe sustainably managed family estate has a predominantly Shiraz & then Cabernet Sauvignon focus. The smaller plantings of Chardonnay & Semillon also benefit from John’s fastidious winemaking skills, instilled during his early days as a specialist white winemaker.\nA modern, but minimalist, approach to crafting the wines is taken. Respecting the fruit is crucial. Small batch open fermentation, gentle handling, pressing and maturation result in balanced, food friendly wines, expressive of their terroir and variety.\nFrom it’s genesis in 1998, when the first wine (Shingleback Shiraz) was released under the Shingleback label, the Shingleback portfolio has grown into a collection of fine wines that include Shingleback, Haycutters, Red Knot and The Gate.\nEach made in its distinct style, these wines showcase the best the McLaren Vale region has to offer. \nThey also represent a family committed to producing outstanding wines from the land they love."

And cooler days are just as casual, sipping a glass of Shiraz Mataro in front of the open wood fire. \nOpen Thursday - Sunday, it’s Friday afternoon onwards where it really comes alive. Between local musos performing live gigs and a rotating roster of finger-lickin’ food trucks, the good times never stop. All under the watchful eye (and wagging tail) of Sandy the cellar door dog. \nIf a genuinely laid-back Fleurieu lifestyle is the experience you seek, alongside some delicious wines to boot, look no further than Big Easy Radio."

Richard is the outside man, farmer and maker; Malcolm is the inside guy, director and creator. What started as our “bottle project” in 2011 has now endured and sprouted into our much-loved wine brand.\nWe believe regenerative agriculture is our guiding philosophy. It is a dynamic holistic system which is down to earth, but also futurist. It is input focused, not process or market driven.  For us, this brings tension to our wine. Then, the way this releases in the glass is exciting, truly expressing vineyard & variety.\nOur people are devoted to this cause, this is life on a loop, giving back, growing forward, and having fun. Making better wines with a lighter footprint, and being Carbon Neutral certified since February 2021.\nIf you are new to our path, let’s have fun along the way, make some memories, come with us at Hither & Yon."
